Title: Hello, Internet!

Today I decided to pick up blogging again and asked the question; what to use? I had a simple requirement; 'it has to support Markdown-formatted documents'. The reasoning behind this is simple; I want to be able to use `Pandoc` to generate other kinds of output if needed. Plus GitBook has an online editor which allows me to write the articles as if they are chapters in a book.

Chris Smart, who is the creator of the Korora project, suggested me to have a look at Pelican. So I did, and this resulted in the blog you are reading at the moment.

Publication is all automated using GitLab CI runners. The project for this is available at [blog](https://gitlab.com/gbraad/blog). For the moment it is still a test and I will try to theme it over the coming days. Anyways, progress can be tracked here...
